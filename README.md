## Guidelines

1. Documentation -- follow the principle _“Code tells you how; Comments tell you why”_. When in doubt, err on the side of verbosity.

2. Maintain code hygine. Linter warnings should be either removed or suppressed with reason.

3. Keep extensibility in mind when designing things. Interfaces should either be  self-documenting or well documented.

4. Use variable naming / class naming so that things are as self-explanatory as possible.

Start from **main.py** and follow along the comments. Good luck!
